        <h1>Smoky Grilled Pork Chops</h1>
        <img src="./images/pork.jpg" height="200" width="200">
        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>A homemade seasoning flavors these grilled pork chops for a spicy,
                smoky flavor. These family-favorite chops are always requested at barbecues. 
                I like to serve them with loaded baked potatoes and a garden salad.
            </p>

        <h3>Ingridients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon seasoning salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            </ul> 
        <h3>Directions</h3> 
            <Ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for indirect cooking over medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Mix seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, and liquid smoke together in a small bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
                <li>Rinse pork chops. Sprinkle wet chops on both sides with spice mixture. Massage spices into meat, then let stand for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Cook chops on the preheated grill over indirect heat until no longer pink inside, about 12 minutes per side. 
                    An instant-read thermometer should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
