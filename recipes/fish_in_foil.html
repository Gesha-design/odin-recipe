            <p>
                Baked fish in foil is a "no-smell" fish recipe, and the only one I make for my family (I hate fish, they love it!). 
                Take foil packets to the table for service, and keep the packets around for wrapping and discarding bones and skin. 
                Then when dinner's done, haul those babies to the outside trash.
